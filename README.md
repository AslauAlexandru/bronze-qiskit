Our introductory material to introduce the basics of quantum computation and quantum programming. 

We plan to have three set of materials here: **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold**. 

## Bronze

Bronze is ready to use and it is updated time to time.

Bronze is a collection of [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) using python as the programming language and [qiskit library](https://qiskit.org) for writing quantum programs.

Bronze can be used to organize three-day long workshops or to design a 2-credit lecture for the second or third year university students.

Bronze was created by [Abuzer Yakaryilmaz](http://abu.lu.lv) ([QLatvia](https://qsoftware.lu.lv)) in October 2018, 
and the most part of it had been developed by him until July 2019. 
Starting from July 7, 2019, Bronze has been on a public gitlab repository and it is expected to have contributions from public as well.

By September 2019, Bronze and its versions have been used in more then 20 two-way or three day workshops:

[Workshops by QLatvia](https://qsoftware.lu.lv/index.php/workshops/)
[Workshops by QTurkey](https://qsoftware.lu.lv/index.php/workshops/)
[QDrive](https://qsoftware.lu.lv/index.php/qdrive/)


## Silver & Gold

Silver is expected to be available here by November 2019. 

We use [QPool2019](https://gitlab.com/qkitchen/qpool2019) for preparing the materials.
