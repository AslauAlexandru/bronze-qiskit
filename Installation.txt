3) Execute the command "jupyter notebook" under the root directory of our tutorial, i.e.,
execute the command "jupyter notebook" in the command line 
OR 
write the command "jupyter notebook" to the address bar and press enter.

You should see all files and directories under our tutorial in the opened (main) Jupyter notebook.


4) Open a terminal from Jupyter notebook (on the right, New -> Terminal) and then Install Qiskit by executing the following command
pip install qiskit
OR, if you update your qiskit,
pip install -U qiskit

You might see certain errors during Qiskit installation. If the test notebook ("Hello_from_quantum_world.ipynb") will be executed without any problem, then there is no need to worry about these errors.


5) Start with the notebook "index_bronze.ipynb" from the main notebook, and test your system by using the notebooks listed under "Test your system"
